# 3D-point

A program that represents various objects in three dimensional space, along with a point at the center of each object. Utilizes inheritance and abstract methods to compute and return the surface area and volume of a shape, and also concrete subclasses to compute the distance of the center of each shape from the origin. Additionally, Java's Comparable interface is implemented, along with an inner class, to order the shapes in ascending order by volume, and descending order by distance from the origin.
